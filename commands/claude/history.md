# /rune:history — View Capture History

Show recent captures from organizational memory.

## Steps

1. Call `capture_history` MCP tool with parameters from $ARGUMENTS:
   - `--domain <domain>` → filter by domain
   - `--since <YYYY-MM-DD>` → filter by date
   - `--limit <N>` → number of results (default 20)
   - No arguments → show last 20 captures

2. Display results as a table:

```

Timestamp            | Record ID                        | Title                    | Domain
2026-03-16T10:00:00Z | dec_20260316_arch_abc             | JWT Auth Migration       | security

```

3. If no entries found:
   - "No captures recorded yet. Rune captures decisions automatically during conversations."
