# /rune:deactivate — Deactivate Plugin

Switch from active to dormant state. Configuration is preserved — use `/rune:activate` to re-enable.

## Steps

1. Read `~/.rune/config.json`.
   - Not found: Respond "Nothing to deactivate. No configuration exists." and stop.

2. Check current `state`:
   - Already `"dormant"`: Respond "Rune is already dormant." and stop.

3. Update `~/.rune/config.json`:
   - Set `state` to `"dormant"`
   - Set `dormant_reason` to `"user_deactivated"`
   - Set `dormant_since` to current timestamp (e.g., `"2026-03-26T10:00:00Z"`)

4. Call `reload_pipelines` as a **native MCP tool** (`mcp__plugin_rune_rune__reload_pipelines`) — invoke it directly like any other tool, do NOT use `claude mcp call` via Bash (that subcommand doesn't exist).
   - This ensures MCP tools (`capture`/`recall`) immediately return errors instead of processing.

5. Respond: "Rune deactivated. Organizational memory is paused. Config preserved — `/rune:activate` to resume."
