# /rune:capture — Store Context

Capture organizational context to encrypted memory.

The argument `$ARGUMENTS` contains the context to capture.

## Activation Check

1. Read `~/.rune/config.json`. If missing or `state` is not `"active"`, respond:
   "Rune is dormant. Run `/rune:configure` and `/rune:activate` first."
   Do NOT attempt any storage.

## When Active

1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` as the context to capture.
2. Add metadata: timestamp, domain classification (infer from content).
3. Use the Rune MCP tools to embed and store the context.
4. Confirm what was stored with a brief summary.

## Example

```
/rune:capture We chose PostgreSQL over MongoDB for better ACID guarantees
```
